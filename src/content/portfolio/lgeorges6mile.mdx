## Project overview

L. George's Coney Island is a restaurant website I built in WordPress as part of the WebmastersDesktop team for a client in Detroit. The goal was to deliver a clean, mobile-friendly site that helps customers quickly find menu details, location information, and hiring opportunities.

The build focused on practical everyday use: easy menu browsing, clear navigation, and a fast way for applicants to submit an employment request directly from the site.

## Challenge

The challenge was balancing speed and usability for a local restaurant audience while keeping backend editing simple for the owner team. The site needed to support content updates without creating maintenance overhead.

## Solution

I implemented the website using **WordPress** with **BeTheme + BeBuilder**, which gave the project a reliable and flexible foundation for layout and content updates. I also integrated an employment form so job applications can be submitted directly from the website.

The result is a practical business site that supports customer discovery and hiring while staying easy to manage long-term.
