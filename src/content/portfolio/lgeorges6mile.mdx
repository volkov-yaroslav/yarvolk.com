## Project overview

Bruce Mansion is a venue website I built in WordPress as part of the WebmastersDesktop team for a client in Michigan. The client provided the design direction, and my role was to translate that design into a fast, maintainable, and user-friendly website.

The final build includes core pages for services and venue details, a dedicated events section, multiple booking flows, a gallery, and a contact page. The focus was to keep the experience clean for visitors while giving the client a practical content workflow.

## Challenge

The project needed to match an existing design while supporting several functional requirements: event listings, booking journeys, contact capture, and easy day-to-day content updates. The challenge was combining all of that into a consistent experience without overcomplicating the backend for the client team.

## Solution

I built the website using **Blocksy** and **Greenshift** to keep layout implementation flexible and scalable. For forms, I integrated **Fluent Forms**, and for appointment workflows I implemented **Amelia**. This stack gave the client a solid balance: visual control on the content side with reliable booking and inquiry flows on the business side.

The result is a polished multi-page website that reflects the brand direction, supports event and booking operations, and stays simple to manage.
