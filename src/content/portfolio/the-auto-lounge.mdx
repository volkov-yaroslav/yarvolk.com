## Project overview

The Auto Lounge is an auto repair website I built in WordPress as part of the WebmastersDesktop team for a Michigan client. The project scope was much larger than a typical service site, with deep service coverage and a broad vehicle catalog structure.

The final implementation includes 30+ service pages and 50+ vehicle-specific pages, supported by a structure that makes it easy for users to find relevant repair information and request service.

## Challenge

The main challenge was handling a large amount of content while keeping navigation clear and performance stable. The site needed to remain user-friendly despite the scale of pages and internal linking.

## Solution

I built the project with **WordPress**, using **Blocksy + Greenshift** for scalable page building and consistent section design across many page types. I also used **ACF** to define custom post types and structured fields for the vehicle pages, which made the catalog easier to scale and manage. I implemented service booking and contact forms to support lead capture and customer requests.

The result is a high-coverage automotive website that stays organized for users and manageable for the client team.
