    - question: "How much do your services cost?"
      answer: |
        Every project is different, so I price based on scope and timeline. Send me a quick summary and I'll suggest the best path.

    - question: "Do you offer your services separately?"
      answer: |
        Yes. I can help with specific tasks like WordPress development, e-commerce setup, automations, or marketing support.

    - question: "Can you transfer my Wordpress site over to Astrojs?"
      answer: |
        Yes. I can migrate or rebuild existing sites, and I can also improve performance and structure along the way.

    - question: "How can I get support?"
      answer: |
        You can reach me by email or messenger. I also offer ongoing maintenance for clients who want priority support.

    - question: "Can you help with my existing React/Astrojs project?"
      answer: |
        Yes. I can jump in for consulting or development. If you're not sure, share the repo or a quick brief and I'll advise.
